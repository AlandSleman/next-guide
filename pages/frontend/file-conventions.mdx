# File conventions

## Loading

You can create a special file named loading.js for each page this will render while the page data is being fetched by in the background by Next.js.
From the Next.js docs:

> “you can show an [instant loading state](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming#instant-loading-states) from the server while the content of a route segment loads”.
> 

So now after we added the loading.js file the user immediately gets feedback from our website when navigation while next.js is fetching the content related to that specific page.
