## Server Components

Server Component is a new feature that has been introduced in React 18, and has been adopted by the Next.js 13, Server components allow you to  render components on the server and send the result to the client **without shipping any javascript.**

### **[Key Benefits of React Server Components](https://codedamn.com/news/reactjs/react-server-components-performance#what_are_react_server_components)**

1. **Reduced JavaScript bundle size**: RSCs can help reduce the size of your JavaScript bundle by rendering parts of your application on the server. This can lead to faster load times and improved performance on slower devices and networks.
2. **Improved initial load time**: Since RSCs don't require JavaScript to render, the browser can display their content as soon as it receives the HTML from the server. This can lead to faster initial load times, particularly for content-heavy applications.
3. **Simplified data fetching**: RSCs can handle data fetching on the server, which can simplify your application's data management and reduce the need for client-side data fetching libraries.
4. **Automatic code splitting**: React Server Components enable automatic code splitting, meaning that the code for each RSC is only loaded when it's needed. This can further reduce the size of your JavaScript bundle and improve application performance.

Every component you declare by default it is a server component, if you try to declare any client event for example put an onClick event on a server component you’ll get a Runtime error, so you need to make that component a Client component.

## Client Components

[From the Next.js docs:](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#client-components)

> Client Components enable you to add client-side interactivity to your application. In Next.js, they are [pre-rendered](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering#component-level-client-and-server-rendering) on the server and [hydrated](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering#component-level-client-and-server-rendering) on the client. You can think of Client Components as how components in the [Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages) have always worked.

To make a client component you have to create a new file and put the ****"use client"**** directive at the top of the file

## **[When to use Server and Client Components?](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#when-to-use-server-and-client-components)**

To simplify the decision between Server and Client Components, I recommend using Server Components (default in the `app` directory) until you have a use case for a Client Component.

This table summarizes the different use cases for Server and Client Components:

## How to use Client components

Now we have an understanding of what is are Server and Client components lets build a small demo showcasing how to use them together, we'll build a simple client search system:

//Iframe and  

### Creating server components

Create a new file in …/… this page will contain the interface for our example list,

//code snippets

### Creating client components

Create a new file named sreac.tsx in ../.. this component will handle all the client events and will search through the given list from the server:
