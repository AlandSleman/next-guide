# Root Layout

So let's start with the main change in Next 13: the app router. What is it and what has changed?

In Next 12, we used the **`_app.js`** file to specify the root of our project, which served as the main entry point for our application. However, in Next 13, we no longer have that. Instead, we have the new **`layout.js`**. It essentially serves the same purpose as the **`_app.js`** file.

Now Let's begin by creating our project. You can start with me by running **`npx create-next-app`** and choosing the default options.

Let’s go through the Root layout which is `layout.tsx`:

```jsx
import './globals.css'
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google'

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })

export const metadata = {
  title: 'Create Next App',
  description: 'Generated by create next app',
}

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className}>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

## Root Component

In Next 13, we define the **`RootLayout`** component in `layout.js`, which receives **`children`** as props, similar to how it’s done in `_app.js`. This provides us with the ability to structure our HTML document by directly including the **`html`** and **`body`** tags. Such a level of control was not available in Next 12, where the generation of these tags was handled internally.

With _app.js you just have a simplified version:

```jsx
import '../styles/globals.css';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}

export default MyApp;
```

## Metadata

There is a new and simplified way to define the metadata of our application. We can now export an object with each field representing a specific metadata attribute. This makes it  easier to manage and update the metadata for our app:

```tsx
export const metadata = {
  title: 'Create Next App',
  description: 'Generated by create next app',
}
```

The `metadata` object and `generateMetadata` function exports are generated on the server and **only supported in Server Components.** You can’t use the Head component in the new App router:

```jsx
// This doesn't work, the meta tags won't show up.
import Head from "next/head";

const metadata = {
  title: 'Create Next App',
  description: 'Generated by create next app',
}

function MyPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>{metadata.title}</title>
        <meta name="description" content={metadata.content} />
      </Head>
      
    </>
  );
}

export default MyPage;
```

Metadata can be either static or dynamic:

```tsx
import { Metadata } from 'next';

// Static metadata
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: '...',
  description: '...'
}

// Dynamic metadata
export async function generateMetadata({ params }) {
  return {
    title: '...',
		description: '...'
  };
}
```

Dynamic metadata allows for greater flexibility and customization. For example, you can query the page title from a database for each specific page. For further information about metadata in Next.js and to explore additional details for the metadata, you can refer to the **[official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata)**.
